Hello! I am Eeshan, a final year undergraduate in Math and Computer Science, at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/). I am part of the [Reliable Autonomy Group](https://mitras.ece.illinois.edu/group.html) at Illinois, and am very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Sayan Mitra](https://mitras.ece.illinois.edu/index.html).

My research interests are in developing theory and practical tools to ensure safety and reliability of autonomous systems. I am particularly interested in the intersection of formal methods, control systems, and machine learning. I have been recently working on a problem identifying and resolving blindspots  in hybrid control systems using neural network verification and symbolic AI.

Beyond academics, enjoy [teaching](https://wiseapp.in/rubiks-cuber/) and [solving](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015ZELE01) Rubik's Cubes, and practicing [Aikido](https://aikidocia.org/).

Selected Projects and Experiences
======

* Reliable Autonomy Group
======
Working on the problem of computing indistinguishable sets to find blindspots in control algorithms in hybrid systems. Developed a computational technique parallelizing SMT solvers, and an inference method using neural network verification to find indistinguishable sets fast for any control system.

Arrows represent agents in 2D space and heading angle. Black markers are landmarks. Agents with same colors are percieved as identical observation.</figcaption>

* WiSE
======
I was part of the Women in Science and Engineering from Rural Parts of India ([WiSE](https://wiseapp.in/)), outreach program, at IIT Bombay. Taught 160+ girls how to solve the Rubik's Cube.

* Intel
======
Interned with Atom DA team, creating software helping in CPU model evaluation. Worked on a few verification scripts and dashboards currently in production.
